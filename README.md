# movie_app
This app gets movie data from https://www.api.themoviedb.org backend API. It also uses content provider implemented via the latest Room Db for storing user favorite movie locally on the device.  A user can easily invite friends to the app via a share button and can stream movie trailer via an embedded YouTube API.

Check MainActivity.java line(24) to add your API_KEY. Alternatively, a TODO has been added to the line for easy access.
